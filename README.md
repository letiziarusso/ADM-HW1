# ADM-HW1
Hi! this is my first ADM homework submission!

In this folder you'll find two different files **.ipynb** in which there are the exercices' scripts.
Both files start with the title (*Problem 1* and *Problem 2*).

About *Problem 1*:
* every subsection has a title;
* every exercice of the subsection has a number and a title too;
* finally, there's the code that solves the problem.

About *Problem 2*:
* there isn't any subsection;
* every exercice of the problem has a number and a title too;
* finally, there's the code that solves the problem, just like in *Problem 1*. 

In this folder you'll find a sub-directory (*scripts*) in which there are two **PDF** files containing my submissions page on [HackerRank](https://www.hackerrank.com/dashboard).

One **PDF Printout** is for *Problem 1* and the other one is for *Problem 2*.
